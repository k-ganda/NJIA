## ## ## Forensic Clinical Formatting (P3 Mapping)

This stage maps extracted clinical facts into a structured, medico-legal format aligned with the Kenya Police P3 medical examination form.

### Objective
To reduce clinician documentation burden while improving forensic rigor by pre-filling standardized sections of the P3 form using AI-extracted clinical facts.

---

### Design Approach
- Extracted facts are mapped to P3-equivalent sections:
  - History of assault
  - Physical examination findings
  - Injury timing and mechanism
- The system does not make diagnoses or legal conclusions
- All outputs are explicitly marked as **pre-filled drafts** requiring clinician review

---

### Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards
- Survivor uncertainty is preserved verbatim
- Clinical opinion fields are left blank
- Final validation is performed by a licensed clinician
