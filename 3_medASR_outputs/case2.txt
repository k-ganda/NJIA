I'm here now, and you're safe. Can you, in your own time, just tell me what happened after you left the market? It was, uh, getting dark. I was near the big tree on the shortcut road. Suddenly someone, he grabbed my arm from behind. I, I tried to, I tried to pull away, but he was, he was too strong. Take a breath. You're doing so well. What happened next? He pushed me. Pushed me into the dirt. He pinned my arms above my head. I couldn't move. He was so heavy. I felt my shoulder hit a stone. It made a loud crack sound. I just, I just stopped fighting then. I couldn't, uh, I couldn't breathe.
