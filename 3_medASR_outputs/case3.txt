Can you tell me what you remember from that night? I had a drink. After that, things are unclear. I felt dizzy and unusually tired. I don't remember leaving the place. When I woke up, my body felt sore. There was pain in my lower abdomen. I felt confused and embarrassed. I don't remember consenting to anything. This happened two days ago.
