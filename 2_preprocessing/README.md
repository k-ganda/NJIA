## MedASR Transcription

Cleaned audio files are passed through a medical-grade automatic speech recognition (MedASR) model. The output is a **raw transcript** that includes:

- Verbatim survivor speech
- Hesitations (e.g., “uh”, “um”)
- Natural pauses
- Incomplete or emotionally fragmented sentences

This raw output forms the foundation for later clinical structuring.

## Ethical Design Principles

NJIA is built around the following principles:

- **Trauma-informed AI**: Survivors speak once; AI handles documentation.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Clinicians retain final control and review.
- **Privacy by design**: No real survivor data is used.
- **Justice-centered**: Documentation is optimized for medical-legal use, not just clinical notes.

This project is a **research and prototype system**. It does not replace professional medical, legal, or forensic evaluation and is not intended for live clinical deployment without regulatory approval and ethical oversight.
